Plugins for Spigot (https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/about-spigot) that customize a Minecraft server for my younger brother and his friends

* **AutoRespawn** - automatically respawns the player when they die
* **AutoUnloadChunks** - automatically unload unsused chunks when player disconnects from the server for optimization

* **CommandBlockFilter** - blacklists certain commands from being used in a command block
* **FunWithCommands** - proof of concept for making custom commands
* **HidePlayerName** - hides player names that usually float above their heads without having to hold the "sneak" key

* **LoginTP** - teleports players to a specified location upon joining the server

* **NoDamageDelay** - Removes usual delay that occurs when player is damaged, where players are invulnerable for a brief period after taking damage
* **PlayerCommandFilter** - blacklists certain commands from player use
* **RapidFire** - each arrow a player fires spawns another arrow as long as the initial projectile is still in the air
